# Development

## Edit theme

You can edit the installed theme for development.

```bash
$ zed ~/Library/Application\ Support/Zed/extensions/installed/charm-mono/
```

When you modify the theme, Zed will reload the theme automatically.

After you finish the development, you can copy the `charm-mono.json` contents to this project.

## Release Extension

1. Update version in `extension.toml`.
2. Create a tag with the version number (e.g., `v0.1.0`).
3. Push the tag to the repository, then the GitHub Actions will make PR to [Zed extensions](https://github.com/zed-industries/extensions).
4. Wait for the PR to be merged, then the new version will be released.
